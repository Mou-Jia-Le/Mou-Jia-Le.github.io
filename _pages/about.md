I am a geochemist and geodynamicist studying the thermal and chemical evolution of Earth’s interior. My work integrates geochemical constraints from mantle-derived rocks with physical models of mantle and lithospheric processes to understand long-term changes in Earth’s tectonic and thermal state.


I was born in Chongqing, China, near the Three Gorges region, where the Yangtze River cuts through mountainous terrain to form a series of deep gorges. Growing up in this landscape fostered a lasting appreciation for the outdoors and physical activity. Outside of research, I enjoy hiking as a way to stay connected to natural landscapes, and I regularly play badminton and football, which help me maintain balance and focus alongside academic work
