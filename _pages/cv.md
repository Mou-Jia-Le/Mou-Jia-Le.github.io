I am a geochemist, igneous petrologist and geodynamicist studying the thermal and chemical evolution of Earth’s interior. My work integrates geochemical analysis with physical models of mantle and lithospheric processes to understand long-term changes in Earth’s tectonic and thermal state. Please refer to the [Research](/research/) page for a detailed overview of my work.

<strong>
I am currently seeking postdoctoral positions in geochemistry and geodynamics, with a focus on magmatic processes, mantle dynamics, and crustal evolution. If you have any potential opportunities, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:moujiale@rice.edu">moujiale@rice.edu</a>.
