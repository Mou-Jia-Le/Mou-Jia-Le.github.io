      <h2>1. Mantle melting and thermal evolution</h2>
      <p>
      I investigate how mantle peridotites record melt extraction through time, using olivine forsterite (Fo) content,
      Re-Os depletion ages, and whole-rock major-element systematics. By combining global xenolith datasets with
      thermodynamic modeling, I reconstruct secular changes in mantle potential temperature and test when modern-style
      plate tectonics began.

      This work addresses a fundamental question: when did Earth start efficiently cooling via subduction-driven
      recycling, and how did that transition affect long-term habitability?

      <h2>2. Sulfide transport and ore formation in magma systems</h2>
      <p>
      I model the motion of immiscible sulfide droplets through crystal-rich magmatic mush (Bushveld-style layered
      intrusions and komatiitic conduits). Using multiphase flow simulations, I explore how physical segregation,
      permeability, and dihedral angles control the focusing of platinum-group-element (PGE)–rich sulfides into
      ore-grade horizons.

      Understanding this filtering process links micro-scale melt connectivity to economic metal deposits.

      <h2>3. Planet formation and early Earth analogs</h2>
      <p>
      I build dynamical models of planetary embryos growing in a gaseous protoplanetary disk through pebble accretion,
      gravitational scattering, and late giant impacts. The goal is to understand why our Solar System avoided forming
      a close-in chain of super-Earths, unlike most observed exoplanetary systems.
      </p>
      <p>
      Connecting early planetary assembly to present-day geochemical signatures helps us test how “Earth-like” other
      rocky worlds may actually be.
